        <h1> Web Development Final Assignment Report</h1>
        <h1> By Ricco</h1>
        <div>
            <h1> Introduction: </h1>
            <h2> What is the essential story being told by your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement? </h2>
            <p> My website is a Juggling newsletter, focusing on the news, records, patterns, jugglers and props of juggling. This website is for anyone new or old to juggling to stay updated with the latest news and records of juggling. This website also has a shopping section, for anyone interested in getting props for themselves. <br> I chose to implement a flex/grid structure to each webpage. Each webpage slightly differs in design, but I have aimed for consistency throughout webpages to ensure a smooth transition for the user. The first page (index.html) uses a grid structure, while the rest use a flexbox structure. Each webpage has a around 2 or 3 rows. In mobile orientation, flex-wrap is used and each item is pushed below another. Each webpage is completely structured in 1 "section" tag (except props.html), where all content is found within. Subsequently, further containers are divided by "div" tags which each hone their own unique element. As juggling is a playful and light activity, I tried to implement and playful and light feel to the website, with the use of colours and unique content, which may not be seen in a typical website.   </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Inspiration: </h1>
            <h2> State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. </h2>
            <p> There have been many websites, videos, and people that have inspired me as I have been creating this website, with the implementation of new ideas continuously being juggled. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Juggling Wiki (https://juggle.fandom.com/wiki/Juggle_Wiki)  - The Juggle Wiki inspired the way I layed out my index.html page, with gridbox for the latest news and other page sections. The juggle wiki is also where I got most of my information for the juggling news, juggling records, jugglers, and juggling patterns.</li>
                <li>Juggling-Records (https://www.juggling-records.com/) - This website inspired me to have a records section on my website. The bulk of the records information was retrieved from this site, as well as the idea to have flags and video links with each record table row. </li>
                <li> Eivind Dragsjo - Eivind is a youtuber and juggler with great juggling content, creativity and news videos. His monthly juggling news videos inspired me to take that concept it and translate it into website form. His playful and colourful style also inspired the colours and playfulness of the website. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Accessibility: </h1>
            <h2> State 3 ways in which your site is accessible to those with different abilities and needs. </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Font Size - I have added a feature to change the font size of each webpage. There is an option of small text, medium text, and large text. This will greatly be of benefit for those with weakened vision or impaired vision and a great add-on for those who like to customize the layout of a webpage. Increased text size can be used for those where the screen is far or too small, and a smaller text size can be used for those perhaps in a public space where they want to keep their digital browsing private. </li>
                <li> Semantic tags. Alt, title, and label attributes. Alternate text is essential to those with screen readers, or browsers that do not support the content. I have used a range of good semantic tags to clearly convey what each section of a webpage is for, as well as using clear descriptive titles, labels and alt text for all elements needing it. </li>
                <li> @webkit - For browser support, @webkit has also been used for all animation found on the website.  </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Usability: </h1>
            <h2> State 3 ways in which you considered the usability of your site. </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Header/Footer - A header and footer is found in each page of the website. This allows for a continuous consistent feel of the website, has well as for good navigational purposes. </li>
                <li> Media Queries + Responsive Design - A use of media queries and responsive design allows anyone from any type of device to view the website without any errors or overlapping of content. This website has been designed to be used by mobile phones, tablets, desktops, and anything in-between. </li>
                <li> Lazy loading + Compressed images - All images have been compressed and lazy loading has been implemented. This allows a quicker loading of the website, especially for slower, older or smaller devices. </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Learning: </h1>
            <h2> State 3 things you had to learn or find out to create your site. How did you achieve that? </h2>
            <p> I have learnt an incredible amount making this website. As I had no prior web development experience, everything seen is something new I've learnt. I achieved this through the combination of lectures given, youtube tutorials, and websites teaching web development.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Grid and flexbox. I have a learnt a great deal about grid and flexboxes, including how they are essential to laying out a website, how to make it responsive, how to align the items within, and how to structure each item. I learnt how to use flexbox and grids through w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and youtube tutorials by 'Web Dev Simplified' (https://youtu.be/9zBsdzdE4sM and https://youtu.be/fYq5PXgSsbE).</li>
                <li>The importance of web accessibility and usability. The lectures provided taught me a great deal on web accessibility and usability, the importance of it, and how to implement it. (Such as the adjusting of font sizes, alt text for images, and responsive design). Honestly, I did not know things like screen readers existed, nor how common and vital (and needed by law) it is to implement web accessibility. I am glad I have delved and learnt much about this section which I once never knew about. </li>
                <li>Javascript functionality. I have learnt how javascript is used for the functionality of a website. This includes the use of event handlers, on-event functions, and query selectors.  </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Evaluation I: </h1>
            <h2> What aspects of your work do you think were particularly successful? Why? </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I believe my use of tables for records.html was particularly successful. I am satisfied the way I styled the 1st column using a gradient, and each 2nd column thereafter. I am pleased the way I implemented the sorting buttons of the table, as well as the flags and video logo for externals links. I am happy with the clean and simplistic design.</li>
                <li>I also think my use of animation and transitions was successful. Subtle transitions can be found in the image carousel of the index.html page, buttons of the records.html page, and the modal of patterns.html page. I have implemented a deliberate bouncing animation to the 'bounce' titles found in records.html and jugglers.html which I am proud of, as well as an increasing/decreasing size animation for the 'free shipping' title on the props.html page. This is used to draw the users attention to the free international shipping that is available.   </li>
                <li>My implementation for functionality of a shopping cart was also successful. I successfully implemented the adding and removing of items to a cart, the ability to change the amount in the cart, the automatic updating of pricing, and the purchasing and clearing of the cart. I adapted code from a 'Web Dev Simplified' youtube video. (https://youtu.be/YeFzkC2awTM)  </li>
            </ul>  </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1> Evaluation II: </h1>
            <h2> What aspects of your work could be improved? How might you do things differently another time? </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I have noted the long loading times of the embedded youtube videos found in the jugglers.html page of my website. This slow loading of the website can definitely be improved, and should for a greater retention of users. Next time, I should stray away from direct youtube videos in my website, or add a loader to show the user to wait. </li>
                <li>I can definitely improve on my use of web accessibility. Next time, I would definitely add more accessible features, such as a high contrast mode for those colorblind, a voice-input feature, and adding more customizability for the user, such as changing the colour, container padding, font and text size.   </li>
                <li>Another area to be improved, is the aspect ratio of images, and the way it is stretched or covers a container, which can greatly offset the original ratio of the image. This can be seen in the image carousel of index.html, where the images look too stretched. I will need to learn how to use srcset and aspect tags to solve this.  </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="resources">
            <h1> Resources: </h1>
